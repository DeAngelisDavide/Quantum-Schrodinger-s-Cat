# Schrödinger's Cat Simulation
This program uses Qiskit to simulate the  experiment by Erwin Schrödinger, for illustrating the concept of quantum superposition. The cat, exists in a superposition of being both alive and dead until measured. By applying quantum gates, it's possible manipulate the probabilities of these states.


Requirements:

```plaintext
qiskit
qiskit-aer
qiskit-ibm-runtime
matplotlib
